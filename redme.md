i am gonna be covering whatever i learn about julia in this notes i gonna write everything down in a away that even a newbie could understand.

but before we start i want you to think why do you wanna learn julia.

after you have thought and are ready to learn julia we are gonna start by dowonloading it on our device, you go to this link to dowonload it https://julialang.org/downloads/

after you have dowonloaded it we are gonna install it if you are on mac sorry i am not going to be able to show you how to install it but for windows i am going to share a video link thorugh which you can install it: https://youtu.be/F4F2EcgVz2M

now you are gonna install a code editor i am gonna be using vs code editor i am gonna link a video which is not mine which will explain how to install vs code editor 

for windows : https://youtu.be/bN6DE-4uFNo?t=29
for mac : https://youtu.be/bN6DE-4uFNo?t=159

before we start we wil learn about comments 
sow while we are in the code file i will be wrttting the instructions in comments so comments are displayed in green color and are used to expalin the code and maintain the code so it can be readable, you may write a single line comment by starting with a # symbol and a multi line comment should be written like this:  #= i am a comment =# 

#comments are text which are ignored by julia language

now we can start please go to day - 1
