# Arithmetic Operators

# So these are operators used to perform mathematic operations 

# basic Arithmetic operators are:

#= 
1) Addition (+)
2) Subtracting (-)
3) Multiplication (*)
4) Division (/)
5) Exponent (^)
=#

# these all can be used like this

# 1) Addition (+)

println(1+1)

# 2) Subtracting (-)

println(2-1)

# 3) Multiplication (*)

println(3*2)

# 4) Division (/)

println(9/3)

# 5) Exponent (^)

println(2^10000000)
